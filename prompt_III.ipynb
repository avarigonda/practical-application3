    "\n",
    "We can perform more in-depth analysis of the existing features and possibly engineer new features that might better capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "For example, regarding the gender feature, if it's not providing significant predictive power and there are concerns about bias, it might be prudent to remove it. However, if gender is relevant to the business objective and it contributes meaningfully to the model's performance, then it should be retained.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each model, we can perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize the model's performance.\n",
    "For example, in KNN, we can tune the number of neighbors, in Decision Trees, we can tune the maximum depth or minimum samples split, and in SVM, we can tune the kernel type and regularization parameters.\n",
