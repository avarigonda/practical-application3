    "\n",
    "1. Feature Engineering and Exploration:\n",
    "We can perform more in-depth analysis of the existing features and possibly modify new features that might better capture the underlaying patterns in the data. For example, regarding the gender feature, if it's not providing significant predictive power and there are concerns about bias, it might be prudent to remove it. However, if gender is relevant to the business objective and it contributes meaningfully to the model's performance, then it should be retained.Conducting correlation analysis, feature importance analysis, and visualizations can help in understanding the relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hyperparameter Tuning and Grid Search:\n",
    "For each model, we can perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize the model's performance. For example, in KNN, we can tune the number of neighbors, in Decision Trees, we can tune the maximum depth or minimum samples split, and in SVM, we can tune the kernel type and regularization parameters. Cross-validation can be used to ensure that the model performance estimates are robust and not overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adjust Performance Metric:\n",
    "Depending on the business objective and the characteristics of the dataset, we may need to adjust the performance metric used to evaluate the models. While accuracy is a common metric, it may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets where one class dominates the other. The alternative metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, or precision-recall curves might be more appropriate, especially for binary classification tasks with imbalanced classes. The choice of the performance metric should align with the specific goals of the project and the relative importance of correctly predicting each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring these area, it can potentially improve the performance of the models and make more informed decisions regarding feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation by adjusting performace metric."
