In this practical application, this task was about comparing classifiers, where the Portuguese Banking Information data was used. The banking information had many variables with multiple data types; some had missing values. The business objective in this task was to see if the client would subscribe to the deposit based on client attributes and market campaigning of the data. The data prediction would help optimize marketing strategies, allocate resources effectively, and significantly improve success by promoting term deposit subscriptions. Then we had engineering features, where the bank information features one-hot encoding, which is used for binary features of true or false, and for target columns where 0 is no and one is yes. After this, there is the train/test split with 80% train and 20% split, where both test and train have features and targets. Then, we have the baseline accuracy representing a trivial classifier's accuracy in predicting the majority class for every sample. Then, logistic regression was used to build the basic model of the data, and the accuracy of the logistic regression model had barely a 0.001 difference. Then there was model comparisions, Mode l, T rain Time, Train Accuracy	and Test Accuracy and it shows that for train accuracy and test accuracy that are roughly the same for all models, for train time SVM has the most extended train times compared the other models. Overall, we can improve the performance of the models by feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation by adjusting performance metrics.
